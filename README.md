_SOFTWARE  REQUIREMENT SPECIFICATION_

## Background

The retail industry has seen substantial changes due to evolving consumer behaviors and technology improvements, particularly in the clothes sector. The 
expansion of traditional brick-and-mortar establishments into internet platforms has made shopping more dynamic and easily accessible. Pre-order systems, which enable 
buyers to order things before they are formally released or restocked, are one such  breakthrough in the e-commerce sector.  

The way people shop for clothes has changed as a result of the transition from physical stores to online platforms. Numerous advantages come with e-commerce, 
such as ease of use, a wider range of products, and the flexibility to purchase whenever and from anywhere. The internet's global reach has expedited this trend by  making it possible for both big and small retailers.
